# Power BI Project: Call Center Data Analysis

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the **PwC Remote Internship**, focusing on analyzing call center performance using Power BI. The goal was to create an interactive and insightful dashboard to monitor key metrics, identify trends, and support decision-making.

## Key Features
- **KPIs**: Highlighted key performance indicators such as call resolution time, customer satisfaction scores, and call volume trends.
- **Measures**: Developed custom measures to calculate metrics like average handle time and first-call resolution rate.
- **Calculated Columns**: Added new columns for categorizing data and improving the analysis.
- **Dashboards**: Published and scheduled dashboards from **My Workspace** to the **Workspace**, enabling team-wide access.
- **Gateway Integration**: Configured a data gateway to ensure seamless refresh of live data.
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Implemented RLS to restrict data access based on user roles.

## Workflow
1. **Data Modeling**:
   - Connected to call center data sources.
   - Created relationships and optimized the data model.

2. **Visualizations**:
   - Designed interactive visuals, including line charts, bar charts, and KPI cards.
   - Ensured clarity and user-friendly navigation.

3. **Publishing & Sharing**:
   - Published the report to Power BI Service.
   - Set up a scheduled refresh using the on-premises data gateway.

4. **Row-Level Security**:
   - Defined roles and applied security rules to protect sensitive data.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop**: For data modeling and visualization.
- **Power BI Service**: For publishing and sharing dashboards.
- **Data Gateway**: To enable live data refresh.
- **RLS (Row-Level Security)**: To manage data access at a granular level.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my proficiency in Power BI, including creating advanced dashboards, implementing security, and automating processes for real-time data insights.
